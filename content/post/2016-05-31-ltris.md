**LTris** is a clone of the popular Russian game, Tetris. As you might know, the objetive is not to die. You die when the tiles exceed the screen top. The game gives you _tetrominos_ which are pieces made of four tiles. You can&#8217;t choose which _tetromino_ will give you the game but you can move it and rotate it 90º in order to make lines. Use the arrow keys. Lines are when a full line is made of tiles of tetrominos, no void space. When this happens, the line disappear and you put off the end of the game.
