**BShisen** is an addictive card game. The objective is to remove all tiles in a minimum amount of time. How do I remove the tiles? You must click a pair of cards with the same picture and if they can be connected with a line with less than 3 corners, the tiles are removed.

The game was developed by Kelvin W. Sherlock and now it&#8217;s opensource. The standard deck contains some funny cards but it also contains two more decks. One with flags and the other with runes.
