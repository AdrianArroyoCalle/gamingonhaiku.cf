**Slime Volley** is a multiplayer game inspired by Pong. As in Pong, we have to score points by making our opponent not to return the balls. However, Slime Volley is better because we have different physics. The ball goes down and our characters can go right and left and they can jump. There isn&#8217;t any IA, you must play with a human. However, both local (same keyboard) and online connections are supported.

The game has some funny modes. We can set the ball speed and how many balls are in the game. The game has two full themes, which give a _modern_ look and a _mushroom_ look.

The game screen is clean so we can stay focused in the balls.

Do you like your character look? No? That isn&#8217;t a problem. You can change character&#8217;s skin. There are many, choose wisely.
