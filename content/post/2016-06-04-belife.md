**BeLife** is an implementation of Conway&#8217;s Game of Life. It is known as a zero-player game since the initial input determines the whole game. The game has an infinite grid with cells whit two possible states, dead or alive.

You specify at the beginning which cells are alive and which are dead. There are four rules then:

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

BeLife&#8217;s implementation has some interesting settings like zoom, speed and colors. It also has a collection of special patterns, which have some special effects. Of course you can draw your pattern, just clicking on the grid. If you want more patterns, Wikipedia has an interesting list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#8217;s\_Game\_of_Life][1]
