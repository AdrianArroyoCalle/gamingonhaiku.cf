**Chocolate Doom** is a source port of the original Doom. Its name is a joke refered to how people call original Dooms, &#8220;Vanilla Doom&#8221;. It wants to recreate the experience of the original Doom, so while other Doom engines try to fix bugs, Chocolate Doom tries to behave exactly as original Doom, bugs included. It is being developed by Simon &#8220;Fraggle&#8221; Howard. The game supports different games, which are saved in IWAD files:

  * All DOOMs
  * Chex Quest
  * Hacx
  * Heretic (experimental)
  * Hexen (experimental)
  * Strife (experimental)

And thousands of user created levels. However, user created levels usually require an IWAD file.
