## Where can I find games for ScummVM?

Games that run on ScummVM have copyright so you should buy them. Of course, many companies have disappeared and in some cases the actual copyright holder is unknown, other companies are still alive but their games can&#8217;t be bought. These situations are called abandonware. There are many sites which offer abandonware games. Just google a bit. However, ScummVM offers freeware versions of some games here: <http://www.scummvm.org/games>
