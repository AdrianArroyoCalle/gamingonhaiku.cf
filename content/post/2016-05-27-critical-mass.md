**Critical Mass** is an interesting strategy game. You&#8217;re the red team and you have red protons. You must destroy all blue atoms. Seems easy but it&#8217;s quite hard to win if you enable a good IA.

Every turn you click on a cell. You add a proton to that cell. The cell must be void or with another proton. When an atom reaches a critical mass, it explodes and it sends a proton to the cells near it. You now know how to conquer other atoms, reach critical mass near a blue atom and it&#8217;ll be yours. What if an atom reachs critical mass and the proton it sends allows another atom to reach critical mass. Then you have a chain reaction and they&#8217;re very common in Critical Mass. Use it wisely. You should keep the reaction under control unless you want to lose in a 10 seconds movement!

How many protons is a _Critical Mass?_ It depends on the atom&#8217;s position.

  * Corners: Two protons
  * Edge: Three protons
  * Center: Four protons

Critical Mass has different levels of AI, from _Random_ to _Albert Einstein_. Critical Mass also allows you to play the game with a friend because it supports local multiplayer. Just select _Human_ in the Blue menu.
