**BeMines** is a clone of the well-known Minesweeper for Windows. You must find the mines hidden in the grid. Left click in order to show a cell. If it&#8217;s a mine you lose. Right click in order to put a flag. You must put flags where you think a mine is. How do I know if the cell I&#8217;m going to click is a mine? There are numbers. These numbers show you how many mines are surrounding the cell. There&#8217;s a hint button, you can click the middle button of your mouse and it will show you the cells but it will add 20 seconds to the timer.<figure id="attachment_22" style="width: 503px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
